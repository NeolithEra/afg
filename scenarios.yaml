# At first on_session_started handler must set initial scenario step in session attributes.
#
# On each consequent step parser get current scenario step name and invocation event name
# 1) verify if event trigger is allowed for current scenario step (event name in list of invocation_event_names),
# if not return 'bad_trigger' and reprompt;
# 2) if event is correct, parse: get next scenario step to set as current, action to perform and response
